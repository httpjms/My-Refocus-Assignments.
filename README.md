Hi, I am Jeamie but you can call me Jhem.
26 years old.
My hobbies are playing videogames, coding and watching KPOP.
My goal for this year is to become a successful web developer.

I want to become a successful web developer so I can apply Abroad specifically in Canada so I can be with my twin sister :)
